## Installation

**Step 1: Install Expo CLI** _(we assume you have pre-installed node.js)._

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to install Expo CLI globally:

```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
```

**Step 2: Clone the Project**

- Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.
- Run the following command to clone your project's repository:

```bash
  git clone <repository_url>
```

**Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory**

- Change your working directory to the project folder:

```bash
  cd <project_directory>
```

**Step 4: Install Dependencies**

```bash
  yarn install
```

This will fetch and install all the required packages listed in your **_package.json_** file.

**Step 5: Start the Development Server**

- Launch the Expo development server with the following command:

```bash
  yarn start
```

**Step 6: Testing on Emulators/Devices**

- You can run your project on an emulator or a physical device by following the instructions provided in the Expo development server web interface.

- For example, you can use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code displayed in your browser.

By following these steps, you'll have the project installed and ready for development on your local machine.

- **Tanstack Query**: Enabling seamless data fetching and synchronization.
- **Socket.io**: Facilitating real-time communication.
- **Formik and Yup**: For robust form handling and validation.
- **Dayjs**: For date and time formatting.
- **Axios**: For simplified HTTP requests.
- **Expo libraries**: Including Expo Image Picker, Crypto, and Font for a seamless development experience.

Additionally, **TypeScript** is employed to enhance code quality and maintainability, making VoxChat a more robust and reliable chat application. This combination of technologies and dependencies ensures a smooth user experience, efficient state management, and real-time communication capabilities.
